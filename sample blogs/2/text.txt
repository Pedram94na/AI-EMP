Web applications have become the backbone of the modern internet, enabling dynamic, interactive experiences across browsers and devices. Unlike traditional software, web apps are hosted on remote servers and accessed through a web browser, which makes them incredibly accessible and easy to update.

Popular frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular help developers build fast, responsive interfaces, while Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails power robust back-end systems. Many apps rely on REST APIs or GraphQL for seamless data exchange between client and server.

Web applications span countless use casesâ€”from e-commerce platforms and social media networks to project management tools and collaboration software like Google Docs or Notion.

Security is also a major concern, with best practices around authentication, encryption, and data privacy being essential for protecting user information. As technology evolves, trends like Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), serverless architectures, and real-time web technologies (e.g., WebSockets) are shaping the future of the web.
